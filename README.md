Pull bookmarks from Raindrop.io, convert them to EPUB, and send to Dropbox.

**NOTE:** This code was mostly generated using agentic coding with Zed and Claude 4. I'm not much of a fan of AI coding,
but I wanted to check out what was possible. I'll share some thoughts on this attempt on https://lukehansford.me at
some point. But fair warning that I wouldn't trust this code too much.

## Potential improvements

- I like [this comment](https://github.com/danburzo/percollate/issues/153) about using [singlefile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile?tab=readme-ov-file) for inputs. I could try it out if perollate isn't doing the job parsing websites.
- I can add some custom CSS to percollate so things look better on my Kobo. I may need to play around with font sizes, etc.
